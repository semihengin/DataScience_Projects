# Applied Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of practical data science projects focused on real-world datasets, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning applications. Each project showcases data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.

## üîç Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Iris Flower Classification**
- **Objective**: Classify iris flowers into three species (*setosa*, *versicolor*, *virginica*) based on sepal and petal dimensions.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
  - Machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- **Key Insights**:
  - Achieved high accuracy using supervised learning.
  - Visualized decision boundaries to interpret model predictions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Titanic Survival Prediction**
- **Objective**: Predict the survival of Titanic passengers based on socio-economic factors.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering (handling missing values, encoding categorical features)
  - Supervised Learning (Random Forest, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression)
- **Key Insights**:
  - Gender and ticket class were strong indicators of survival probability.
  - Feature importance analysis helped in optimizing model accuracy.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Customer Segmentation (Paras Team Analysis)**
- **Objective**: Segment customers into different behavioral groups based on purchasing patterns.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, DBSCAN)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
  - Customer profiling based on spending habits
- **Key Insights**:
  - Identified distinct customer personas for targeted marketing.
  - Optimized clustering parameters to achieve meaningful segmentation.

**Note**: This repository is a practical learning portfolio that demonstrates data science applications with a focus on business and real-world scenarios.
